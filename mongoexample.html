        <h1>Walk Through a MongoDB Example</h1>
        <p>FilterView can also be used to display data that is stored in a
        database. Currently, because of its elegant handling of json objects
        natively, we have chosen to work with MongoDB first. If you pull the
        latest code available from our github page, you will be able to test
        out this functionality.</p>
        <p>First, make sure you have downloaded MongoDB 1.6.5 or higher. This
        is important since older versions of MongoDB do not allow you to mix
        the selection of queries (we sometimes left the id of a database
        object for security and speed reasons).</p>
        <p>Second, make sure you have node installed. The code has been
        developed using version v0.2.5, but as long as the version is
        compatible with the packages below, using more recent versions is
        welcome. The package has been tested with node v0.4.0, so anything
        up to this point should be fine too. Be sure to have the following
        packages installed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Express v1.0.1</li>
            <li>Node-static v0.5.3</li>
            <li>node-mongo-native</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The first two are available using node's package manager, npm,
        while the latter must be pulled directly from github. Make sure you
        have it linked into the commonJS setup; otherwise it won't be able
        to be imported when the server is started. It is currently the best
        API between node and MongoDB, and for this reason it is required for
        using FilterView via a server.</p>
        <p>After all the installation is completed, cd into the root
        directory of the FilterView repo and checkout the master
        branch. Then make sure you have the MongoDB server running by
        executing the command from the FilterView root directory:</p>
        <pre class="Rstyle">mongod --dbpath ./db --directoryperdb --port 27018</pre>
        <p>You should see a successful startup of the database. Once this is
        running, from the FilterView directory start up the node server:</p>
        <pre class="Rstyle">node server.js</pre>
        <p>If you don't see any error messages, then you should be on your
        way. Next go to the address http:/localhost:8000 in your browser
        (preferrably Firefox, Chrome, or Safari) and you should see a list
        of examples. If you see all the plots, then you are currently
        generating these via the database running on your computer.</p>
