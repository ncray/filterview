        <h1>FilterView Syntax</h1>
        <p>The syntax for the plotting library of FilterView is meant to be
        a generalization of the plotting syntax for R, but in Javascript. Most of the
        functionality from the R command plot has been transplanted into
        this implementation, except for novel concept of the ui and cui elements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="docs">
        <h2>Positional Arguments</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>Invocation with One Argument</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx)</pre>
          <p>If you only supply one parameter, just like in R, it makes this
          the value for y and makes the x coordinates simply the sequence of
          natural numbers. Internally, the x coordinate is given the label
          "xx," which will be important when you want to attach a UI element
          to this coordinate.</p>
          <div class="show" num="0">Show</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Invocation with Two Arguments</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx, foo.yy)</pre>
          <p>When supplying two arguments, the plot simply makes a scatter
          plot based on the two arrays of data fed to the command. Again,
          the internal labels for the x and y coordinates here are 'xx' and
          'yy'.</p>
          <div class="show" num="1">Show</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Option: col</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx, foo.yy, {col: foo.col})</pre>
            <p>When you pass in a third argument, it is assumed to be an
            object containing all objects. If you only supply two arguments
            and the latter is an options object, the plot command will
            assume you are simply supplying the y values and an option
            object. </p>
            <p> The argument 'col' is hardcoded to stand for the color of a
            datapoint. It
            can be either the name of a color (e.g. red) or the rgb code. By
            passing in an array with the same size as the xx and yy array, the
            data will be bundled pointwise with all points.</p>
          <div class="show" num="2">Show</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>UI Elements</h2>
          <p> In order to automatically generate UI elements, you need to
          declare these in the options object. To do this, you simply
          include a key by the name of 'ui' in the options object with the
          value being another object specifying the exact UI elements. </p>
          <p> Currently, the UI element types being supported are:
            <ul>
              <li>Slider elements = "slider" </li>
              <li>Checkbox elements = "checkbox" </li>
              <li>Autocomplete elements = "autocomplete" </li>
              <li>Dropdown/Selector elements = "dropdown" </li>
              <li>Regexp elements = "regexp"</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>One very important facet of these UI elements is that they
          introspect on the datatype in order to accurately provide
          meaningful user selections. For instance, if a slider element is
          created for a continuous variable, it would be meaningless to
          create a slider that only had one handle which selected datapoints
          which precisely matched the value the handle was located
          on. Instead, we automatically create two-handled slider, which
          lets the user bound the range of datapoints on that attribute.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Using One UI element - the Slider</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx, foo.yy, {
    col:foo.col, bar:foo.tt,
    ui:{
        slider:"bar"
    }
})</pre>
           <p>To declare a UI element, you just use the type of the UI and attribute
           you want to index on. Here 'tt' is just a randomly chosen integer from
           1,2, or 3. Notice that to declare the slider for tt, we use the name we
           assign it in the function call, and not its native attribute in the foo
           object. That is, in this example, notice we use 'bar' instead of 'tt' to
           generate a slider object for the tt attribute. </p>
          <div class="show" num="3">Show</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Using Multiple UI elements</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx, foo.yy, {
    col:foo.col, tt:foo.tt,
    ui:{
        checkbox:"tt"
        autocomplete:"col",
    }
})</pre>
          <p>To introduce multiple ui elements, simply include them all in
          the ui object.</p>
          <div class="show" num="4">Show</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Multiple Instance of Same UI Type</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx, foo.yy, {
    col:foo.col,
    ui:{
        slider:["xx","yy"]
    }
}))</pre>
         <p>Mixing UI elements is easy. If they are different types, simply
         include them all inthe ui object. If they are the same type, then
         place them in an array, as in this example. Notice if you specify a
         slider for a continuous variable, then it automatically assumes you
         want the range of that attribute.</p>
          <div class="show" num="5">Show</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Automatic Rescaling</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx, foo.yy, {
    col:foo.col, rescale:true,
    ui:{
        regexp:"col"
    }
})</pre>
          <p>Sometimes its preferrable to have the axis automatically
          rescale when an UI change is made. This can be done by including
          the rescale argument in the options.</p>
          <div class="show" num="6">Show</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Child UI elements (cui)</h2>
          <p>Sometimes we might want the domain of possibilities which a UI
          element can select upon to update as other UI elements change. For
          example, if we adjust the range of permissible datapoints so that
          no red points are shown any longer, we may want our color selector
          to stop including that as a possible choice. This can all be
          accomplished by making it a child UI. A cui element behaves
          exactly like a normal UI element, except after each UI change, it
          updates its domain to select only elements that can possibly be
          selected.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>A cui example</h3>
          <pre class="Rstyle">plot(foo.xx, foo.yy, {
    col:foo.col,
    ui:{slider:"xx"},
    cui:{checkbox:"col"}
})</pre>
          <p>In this example, we see that we get both a slider and
          checkbox as selectors. However, notice that if the range of the
          slider filters out all elements from say the 'red' cluster, then
          it ceases to be an option to select as a checkbox. Once the slider
          is readjusted to accept some red datapoints again, it reappears.
